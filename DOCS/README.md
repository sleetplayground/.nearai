# How to use this repo

the main readme has near ai cli install instuctions, I just thought i would throw a little bit here about how to use the repo

if seting up for the first time on a fresh machine you can clone this to your home directory. and setup near cli. make sure it matched the name .nearai and is in the right location.

this repo conatins docs for lots of things to help your near ai agent devloping process.

you can open this entire folder .nearai in your favorite ide.


the .gitignore files have info on how to clone or download agents.
