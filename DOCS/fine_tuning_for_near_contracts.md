# Fine-Tuning AI Models for NEAR Smart Contract Interactions

## Overview
This guide explores the necessity of fine-tuning AI models for NEAR smart contract interactions and provides practical guidance on implementation. We'll examine when fine-tuning is required versus when existing models are sufficient.

## When is Fine-Tuning Necessary?

### Use Cases That May Require Fine-Tuning

1. **Complex Contract-Specific Logic**
   - Custom token economics
   - Unique governance mechanisms
   - Domain-specific validation rules

2. **Specialized Response Patterns**
   - Contract-specific error handling
   - Custom transaction formatting
   - Specialized data processing

3. **High-Performance Requirements**
   - Low-latency responses
   - High-throughput processing
   - Resource-optimized interactions

### When Standard Models Are Sufficient

1. **Basic Contract Operations**
   - Standard token transfers
   - Simple view calls
   - Basic state queries

2. **Common Interaction Patterns**
   - Standard NFT operations
   - Basic fungible token transfers
   - Simple storage operations

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Using Standard Models with Proper Prompting

```typescript
// Example: NEAR contract interaction with structured prompting
const contractInteraction = async (account: Account, contractId: string, method: string, args: any) => {
  const prompt = `
    Contract: ${contractId}
    Method: ${method}
    Arguments: ${JSON.stringify(args)}
    Account: ${account.accountId}
    Expected: Transaction result format
  `;
  
  const prediction = await model.complete(prompt);
  return account.functionCall({
    contractId,
    methodName: method,
    args: JSON.parse(prediction)
  });
};
```

### 2. Fine-Tuned Model Approach

```typescript
// Example: Fine-tuned model for NEAR contract interactions
class NEARContractAgent {
  constructor(
    private model: any,
    private account: Account,
    private contractId: string
  ) {}

  async processTransaction(method: string, args: any) {
    // Fine-tuned model processes contract-specific logic
    const prediction = await this.model.predict({
      method,
      args,
      contract: this.contractId
    });

    return this.account.functionCall({
      contractId: this.contractId,
      methodName: method,
      args: prediction.args,
      gas: prediction.gas || '30000000000000',
      deposit: prediction.deposit || '0'
    });
  }
}
```

## Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather NEAR contract interaction logs
   - Document successful transaction patterns for specific contracts
   - Collect common error cases and their resolutions
   - Include cross-contract call patterns

2. **Data Preparation**
   ```json
   // Example training data format for NEAR contract interactions
   {
     "input": {
       "contract_id": "nft.examples.testnet",
       "method": "nft_mint",
       "args": {
         "token_id": "token-1",
         "metadata": {
           "title": "My NFT",
           "description": "Test NFT",
           "media": "https://example.com/nft.png"
         },
         "receiver_id": "alice.testnet"
       }
     },
     "output": {
       "args": {
         "token_id": "token-1",
         "metadata": {
           "title": "My NFT",
           "description": "Test NFT",
           "media": "https://example.com/nft.png"
         },
         "receiver_id": "alice.testnet"
       },
       "gas": "200000000000000",
       "deposit": "10000000000000000000000"
     }
   }
   ```
   - Clean and format training data
   - Create input-output pairs
   - Validate data quality

3. **Model Selection**
   - Choose base model (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4)
   - Consider model size vs. performance needs
   - Evaluate cost implications

4. **Training Process**
   ```bash
   # Example fine-tuning command using NEAR AI toolkit
   near ai finetune \
     --model near-llm-base \
     --dataset near-contract-interactions \
     --epochs 3 \
     --learning-rate 2e-5 \
     --batch-size 4 \
     --validation-split 0.2
   ```

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Transaction Success Rate
     * Measure percentage of successful contract interactions
     * Track gas estimation accuracy
     * Monitor deposit amount precision

   - Response Quality
     * Contract method prediction accuracy
     * Parameter formatting correctness
     * Error message clarity

   - Performance Metrics
     * Latency per request
     * Throughput under load
     * Memory usage patterns

6. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Staged rollout process
   - A/B testing with existing models
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - Fallback mechanisms

    if (this.requiresSpecialization(input)) {
      return await this.fineTunedModel.predict(input);
    }
    return await this.standardModel.complete(input);
  }
}
```

## Decision Framework

Use this checklist to determine if fine-tuning is necessary:

1. **Complexity Assessment**
   - [ ] Custom contract logic
   - [ ] Unique interaction patterns
   - [ ] Special validation rules

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - [ ] Response time constraints
   - [ ] Throughput needs
   - [ ] Resource limitations

3. **Cost Considerations**

## Conclusion

Fine-tuning for NEAR smart contract interactions is not always necessary. For many standard contract interactions, properly structured prompts with existing models can provide sufficient functionality. Consider fine-tuning when:

1. Dealing with complex, custom contract logic
2. Requiring specialized response patterns
3. Needing optimized performance

Carefully evaluate the cost-benefit ratio before committing to a fine-tuning approach, and consider hybrid solutions that combine standard and fine-tuned models for optimal results.
